To make the process smoother and more efficient, I prepared a Nix flake that would help me in the development of the exercises. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Nix, it&amp;rsquo;s a package manager that allows for deterministic builds and is particularly helpful when working with multiple dependencies.</description>

You need to have the package manager Nix installed on your system. Also need direnv, for integration, that enables automations.
Install Nix in whatever Linux distribution is simple, just run the installer:</description>
