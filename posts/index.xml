			<description>When I bought a Keychron K2 I knew it would work in Windows and Mac, but I use Linux. But itâ€™s just a keyboardâ€¦ it should work.
Well&amp;hellip; It works! But on my OS Arch Linux with Gnome had a little problem. The FN keys didnâ€™t work perfectly. Actually the FN keys were for MacOS, not Windows.
How I fixed:
 Use the switch on side of keyboard to change to Windows mode Hold Fn + X + L for 4 seconds to set the key row to Function mode  Type in the terminal:</description>

<p>Well&hellip; It works! But on my OS Arch Linux with Gnome had a little problem. The FN keys didnâ€™t work perfectly.
Actually the FN keys were for MacOS, not Windows.</p>
<p>How I fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the switch on side of keyboard to change to Windows mode</li>
<li>Hold <code>Fn + X + L</code> for 4 seconds to set the key row to <em>Function</em> mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Type in the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">echo <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span> | sudo tee /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode
</code></pre></div><p>When doing this your keyboard should work perfectly.</p>
<p>With a small detail: to persist this change you need to add a module option for <code>hid_apple</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;options hid_apple fnmode=0&#34;</span> | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/hid_apple.conf
</code></pre></div><h3 id="important"><strong>Important!</strong></h3>
<p>Now you need to rebuild your <code>initramfs</code> if <code>hid_apple</code> module is included.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu: <code>sudo update-initramfs -u</code></li>
<li>Arch: <code>mkinitcpio -P</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Good! After reboot your OS don&rsquo;t will go miss this configuration and your FN keys will work as if it were Windows.</p>

			<description>Hello, friend. How are you? I&amp;rsquo;m fine and I expect that you are fine too.
So&amp;hellip; this is my blog! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
Yep! You are in it.
I hope that you will have good moments and nice readings here.
About what I&amp;rsquo;ll write? Hmmm&amp;hellip; about everything, I think. You can hope technologies, histories from how I learn something. Example: sometimes I have a trouble in my Linux and I search all over the internet to find a solution.</description>
