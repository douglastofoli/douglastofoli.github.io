      <description>The Planning: I started a new project. Unnamed yet, but I already know about what will be. It looks a bit silly but I want to do a money manager. An application that you can add entries for expenses and incomes.
How I started? Planning! I am planning the database. I intend to use PostgreSQL for my database.
I am using dbdiagram.io to create my schemas
dbdiagram.io On the left side I wrote in code what I want to represent in my tables.</description>

      <description>When I bought a Keychron K2 I knew it would work in Windows and Mac, but I use Linux. But itâ€™s just a keyboardâ€¦ it should work.
Well&amp;hellip; It works! But on my OS Arch Linux with Gnome had a little problem. The FN keys didnâ€™t work perfectly. Actually the FN keys were for MacOS, not Windows.

      <description>Hello, friend. How are you? I&amp;rsquo;m fine and I expect that you are fine too.
So&amp;hellip; this is my blog! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
Yep! You are in it.
I hope that you will have good moments and nice readings here.
About what I&amp;rsquo;ll write? Hmmm&amp;hellip; about everything, I think. You can hope to find subjects about technologies, histories from how I learn something. Example: sometimes I have a trouble in my Linux and I search all over the internet to find a solution.</description>
