      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a way to challenge yourself and improve your programming skills, the Exercism Mechanical March challenge is a great opportunity. This month, I decided to take on the challenge and tackle the Golang track.
To make the process smoother and more efficient, I prepared a Nix flake that would help me in the development of the exercises. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Nix, it&amp;rsquo;s a package manager that allows for deterministic builds and is particularly helpful when working with multiple dependencies.</description>

      <description>I love automations, and set up environments to development is very stressfull. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Nix I&amp;rsquo;ve been had less work to configure my packages and my configurations.
And make your environment productivy is really easy. In some steps.
You need to have the package manager Nix installed on your system. Also need direnv, for integration, that enables automations.
Install Nix in whatever Linux distribution is simple, just run the installer:</description>

      <description>Hello, my name is Douglas, and I am a passionate technology and programming student. Currently, I am studying Software Engineering and have professional experience in languages such as Typescript, PHP, and Elixir.
My programming journey began a few years ago when I decided to dive into the world of technology and learn how to create solutions for complex problems using code. Since then, I have dedicated myself to improving my skills and staying up to date with the latest trends and news in programming languages, tools, and technologies.</description>
